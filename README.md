# Smart Home Device Management System
## Objective
Design and implement a smart home system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This system manages various devices, handles data persistence, controls devices based on conditions, and provides data analysis and visualization.

## Project Description
This project involves creating a smart home management system using Python. Key components include:

* Object-Oriented Design: Base class Device with subclasses Thermostat, Light, and SecurityCamera.
* File Handling: Save and load device data in JSON or CSV format.
* Conditional Logic: Time-based and temperature-based device control.
* Data Logging and Analysis: Periodic logging of device data, stored in Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
* Data Visualization: Use Matplotlib for visualizing data (line charts, bar charts, pie charts).
## Features
* Device Management: Common device attributes and methods, plus specific attributes for different device types.
* Persistence: Save and restore device states using JSON/CSV.
* Automation: Control devices based on time and temperature conditions.
* Analysis: Log device data for analysis with Pandas.
* Visualization: Create charts to visualize device usage and performance with Matplotlib.
## Dependencies
* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Install dependencies using:
* pip install pandas matplotlib
## Usage
* Ensure all dependencies are installed.
* Run the Python script:
* python smart_home.py
* Interact with devices, retrieve and set statuses, and log data.
* Perform data analysis and generate visualizations.
## Insights
Device Usage Patterns: Identify peak usage times and optimize settings.
Performance Monitoring: Detect issues and unusual activity.
User Behavior Analysis: Improve user experience based on interaction patterns.
## Tools Used
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* JSON/CSV
